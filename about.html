    <p> I like to hangout with my friends whenever I get the chance. Recently we went
      to the bowling alley and that was fun, even though i didn't get a very good score
      it was fun to be with my friends. My friends and family are the things are care
      most about, to be able to be with them is wonderful.</p></div>
